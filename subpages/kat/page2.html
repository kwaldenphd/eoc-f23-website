  <h1><center>Memories and Trips Around Europe</center></h1>
  <center><img src="Images/Amsterdam.jpg" alt="Amsterdam" width="240" height="300"></center>
  <p>I traveled to a lot of places when I was in Europe. It was a learning curve figuring out how to travel to places with other people, especially with locations where I didn't know the language, but it made me even more confident. Now, I feel like I can travel anywhere and feel okay! I met so many amazing people, tried so much different food, and saw things I never thought I would see before. My top three places I went to were Prague, Edinburgh, and Amsterdam.</p>
