  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
  <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are baking cookies and macarons, curling, and watching Notre Dame sports games!</p>
  <p>I started baking in middle school with my Grandma. After she taught me many baking skills, I started making macarons. Whenever I am home, I love to make strawberry macarons. With my family, I also make and decorate sugar cookies for different holidays and celebrations.</p>
  <p>Here are some of the cookies that I have made and decorated:</p>
