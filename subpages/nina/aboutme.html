  <h1>Nina Duncheskie</h1>
  <h2>I am from just outside of Philadelphia, PA and I come from a big family. I have 3 brothers, 1 sisters, my 2 loving parents, and my dog!</h2>
  <h3>I am currently studying chemical engineering here at ND and I am loving it!</h3>
  <p>I enjoy hanging out with friends, going on runs, and going to the beach!</p>
  <p>My favorite foods are anything that starts with "buffalo chicken". I also feel that it is my duty to enjoy cheesesteaks because I am from Philly. If you want to know my stance on the best and worst fruits, you should head over to page 2.</p>
