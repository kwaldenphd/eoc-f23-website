  <h1>Cliff Lake, Ontario</h1>
  <p>This is a site about my favorite place on Earth, <a href="https://canadafishinghunting.com/">Cliff Lake</a>. Each summer, my family and I take a week-long fishing trip to this secluded destination in the woods of Nothern Ontario. The lake features gorgeous scenery and incredible fishing; our personal records can be viewed <a href=page2.html>here</a>. It is truly a place like no other and somewhere I'm proud to say I've visited. While in Ontario, we'll see eagles, moose, and bears, making the 17-hour drive well worth it. I hope you think this place is as beautiful as I do!</p>
