  <h1 style="color:lightgreen; border-color: darkgreen; text-align: center; border">NICHOLAS BIFONE</h1>
  <p style="color:seagreen;">My name is Nicholas Bifone, and I'm from Long Island, NY. I love to ski, play volleyball, and listen to music! My favorite singer is Taylor Swift. She's amazing, and I CAN'T WAIT for 1989 (Taylor's Version) to come out, but I also have a pretty great family. I have one brother, one sister, and one dog. Her name is Pixie, named after the pre-school that Justin, Grace, and I all attended. Just recently, I went to Ireland to play in the marching band for the Shamrock Series football game, and they all flew out to see me and the game since none of us have ever been to Europe. Before this trip, the farthest east we've been was Boston, which isn't saying much since we're from Long Island.</p>
