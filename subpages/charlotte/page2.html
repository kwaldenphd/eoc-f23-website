  <p> Instructions: Prehead the grill to medium high heat. Blend the veggies in a food processor or dice small and
    combine all ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Form into about 10-12 patties and grease the grill grates with
    cooking spray. Cook on the grill for 3-4 minutes per side. Serve with burger buns and toppings of choice. Enjoy!</p>
  <p> Side note: I love eating these with sweet potato buns.</p>
