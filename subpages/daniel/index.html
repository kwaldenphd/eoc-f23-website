  <p style="background-color:powderblue; text-align:center; font-family:courier;">This is my dog Zoe.</p>
  <p style="background-color:powderblue; text-align:center; font-family:courier;">We found her this summer running through a main road, we called her and she hoppped right into the car. We put up fliers to try and find the owner, but we never did. She is about a year old, and I love her so much.</p>
