  <h1 style="color:hotpink; text-align:center;">Hi! I'm Molly</h1>
  <p>I am from Isle of Palms, an island outside of Charleston, SC. I am 19, and I am a Chemical Engineering major! My career goal is to revolutionize the way we use plastics and mitigate current oceanic plastic pollution. I love Thai food, and my favorite color is green. I have a cat named Meko, after the racoon from Pocahontas because she has a striped tail, but the shelter spelled her name wrong, and we kept it! </p>

  <p>Fun fact! I'm a transfer student to Notre Dame from the US Naval Academy, so I'm technically a veteran although I never deployed.</p>
  <p> My roommate, Polly, is from dear old </p>
