  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Throughout all my life, I always loved playing games - imaginary games, board games, card games, and (especially) video games! The ability to create magical and fun experiences with the people around me or by myself was something I always loved doing and still enjoy doing to this day. However, video games have taken up most of my life due to being different than most of my peers during my years in primary education, along with moving from school to school without keeping in touch with friends I had known before. Moving also had an effect on me where the people and environment around me changed, meaning I had another experience to start anew once again. Thankfully, no matter where I went, who were my friends, or what happened within my life, video games followed me always. From the kid's game device known as a Leap Frog all the way to PC games now, video games for me were and always will be expressions of art, storytelling devices, and memorable experiences to share with the people around me. From entering the video game atmosphere, I now have amazing friends in my life, a way to relax after a long day of work, and a passion to enter the video game industry to one day create memorable experiences for the next generations of people!</p>
