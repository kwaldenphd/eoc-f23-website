  <h1>A little bit about me!</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Caroline Schafer. I am a Neuroscience and Behavior Major at the University of Notre Dame. Here at Notre Dame, I am involved in several extracuriccular activites. One of my favorites is being a member of the Notre Dame Women's Club Volleyball Team. I have played volleyball for fifteen years, and I am so glad that I can continue playing in college. Here is a link to our website: </p>
