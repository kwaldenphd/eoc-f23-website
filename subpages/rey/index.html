  <h1 style="color:darkolivegreen; text-align:center;">Hello World!</h1>
  <p style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">My name is Rey Ortiz Bautista. I am from Charleston, SC, and currently live in Knott Hall on campus. I have 3
    siblings (2 brothers and a sister), and parents who are the best. I am majoring in Science-Business and minoring in
    Data Science. I do not yet know what I wish to be in the future but I hope it is something I enjoy doing. I love
    playing soccer, going camping, fishing, and being active. At ND, I am part of the Futsal Club where we play soccer
    2-3 times a week. Furthermore, this semester I am engaged in research for Dr. Gursky where we are looking at the
    impact that solid stress has on breast cancer cells. Ultimately, I am excited for this semester and thank you for
    reading my intro. </p>
