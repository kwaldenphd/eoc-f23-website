  <h1> Why you should play Celeste</h1>
  <p>It is a fantasticly fun, dauntingly difficult game. It's good that it's so tough, however, because it forces you to spend more time listening to the soundrtrack, which is my favorite part about the game. It is nothing short of phenomenal, and makes for great study music too!</p>
  <p>You gotta try it. I mean look at this art style!</p>
