  <h1> Pixel Art and Video Game Music is Awesome</h1>
  <p>Look at this interpretation of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom if it were made in pixel art. Isn't it beautiful?</p>
  <p>I have so much respect for the people who make art like this. It looks so time intensive.</p>
  <p>Below is a link (no pun intended) to one of my favorite Zelda music playlists, another page on this site dedicated to a different interest I have, and a third page on this site that shows off a newfound favorite video game of mine.</p>
