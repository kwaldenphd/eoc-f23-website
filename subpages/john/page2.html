  <p> The following is a summary of Louisville Women's Soccer vs. Miami Hurricanes on Sept. 24th, 2023:</p>
  <p> CORAL GABLES, Fla. â€” The University of Louisville women's soccer team were seconds away from a draw before the Hurricanes scored a last-second goal and the Cards dropped the match, 1-0, Sunday afternoon in Coral Gables. The Cardinals held most of the run of play throughout the game but the Canes scored the game-winning goal with two seconds left in regulation.

The Cards and Hurricanes were scoreless through the first half of the match. The teams combined for just seven shots total and only three made frame. Erynn Floyd made back to back saves in the 35th and 36th minute to keep the match scoreless. 

In the second half, the Cardinals increased the pressure on offense in hopes of finding the opening goal. 

The Cardinals looked to have the first goal of the match in the 60th minute when Mackenzie Geigle took advantage of a loose ball in the box and she quickly jumped on it and put it in the back of the net. Unfortunately for the Cards, the official blew the whistle and claimed there was contact with the goalie and the goal was disallowed. 

The clock was ticking down in the final minute as the Hurricanes played a ball up into their offensive third. Katerina Molina gathered the ball and took it right to end line before dropping it back towards the middle of the box. Reese Wheeler was the first to the ball and her shot got through the Cardinals defenders and into the back of the net for the game-winning goal.

The Cardinals will return to campus but will be back out on the road next weekend. Up next for the Cardinals is a short trip north to South Bend to take on Notre Dame. The Cardinals and Fighting Irish will square off on Saturday at 7 p.m. ET and the match will be streamed on the ACC Network Extra.</p>
