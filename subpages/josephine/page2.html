  <h1>Serve and Volley</h1>
  <p>The server should aim down the T and quickly approach the net to avoid being caught in no man's land. Both the server and his/her partner now gain a more offensive position at the net, and they should be looking to attack the net player on the opposite side when possible. The following image shows why serving down the T can be more advantageous than serving out wide; serving down the T helps to prevent opening up the court for the opponent to hit a more difficult return.</p>

  <h1>I-Formation</h1>
  <p>The serving team lines up in the center of the court. Prior to serving, the player at the net signals to his/her partner the direction that he/she will move when the point begins. This is an excellent way to keep one's opponents guessing by creating some indecision in their return game.</p>
