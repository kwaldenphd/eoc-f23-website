  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Crosswords 101</h1>
  <p style="background-color:lavender; font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I love playing games and puzzles during my downtime, and it's time to discuss the best one of all time: crosswords. It's like sudoku that you get bored of less quickly. The only trouble is that so many places make you pay to play! (cough, cough, New York Times) But don't worry, I've found a few places online to play for free. Good luck paying attention during any class/meeting/zoom/social gathering/TV show/wedding/funeral/baby shower/court hearing/etc after this! </p>
