  <h1>Pilot Synopsis</h1>
  <p>Gen has landed a supporting role on the second season of the hottest prestige teen drama, Exuberance. She has a new personal assistant, Naomi, who is the latest in a long line of assistants who have quit their job. It is up to Naomi and the rest of Gen’s team to make sure her first day of filming goes smoothly. However, after a long night of partying, Gen is thoroughly hungover, pissed off at the world, and knows none of her lines.
Additionally, some of the other cast members resent Gen’s attitude and immense privilege, and try to get her to leave the project without endangering their own jobs. It’s up to Gen and her team to pull it together to make sure this project doesn’t end in disaster (like it often does.)
