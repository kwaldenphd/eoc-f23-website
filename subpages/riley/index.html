      <h2>History & General Info</h2>
      <p>The Chapel of the Holy Shroud, otherwise known in Italian as Santissma Sindone, is a chapel in Turin, Italy. Construction of the structure finished in 1694 and was headed by architect Guarino Guarini. With its incredible geometric patterns, black, grey and contrasting marble and gold accents, the chapel is incredibly appealing to view from any angle. One important design detail used by Guarini was an optical illustion known as forced perspective. This illusion works by making farther aways details smaller. Thus, these details used in the higher parts of the chapel make it appear as though the top is farther away from the floor than it is in reality. </p>
