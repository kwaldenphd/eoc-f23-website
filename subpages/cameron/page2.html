  <h1>The ND-Chicago Summer Experience: A Consulting Whizz?</h1>
  <p>This summer, I worked at KPMG as a Cyber Threat Management intern in sunny, warm Chicago, Illinois.</p>
  <p>In the fall after I graduate from the University of Notre Dame, I will be returning to KPMG full-time as a Federal Cybersecurity Associate. Back to Washington, D.C. for me!</p>
  <p>Below, you will find a table consisting of average Consulting starting salaries at KPMG in Chicago and D.C., and a link to the firm's Cyber Service Line</p>
